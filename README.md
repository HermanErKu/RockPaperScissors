# RockPaperScissors

Simple rock, paper, scissors game using WPF C#


## How it works

The application is simple, it just mimics the fun of playing rock, paper, scissors, but with a computer.

You start by launching the application which will give you 3 choices; rock, paper or scissors.

When you choose one of them, the computer will automaticly play against you, and one of you will win.
